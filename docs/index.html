    <p>
      I am a Computer Programming student with a strong interest in
      web design and technology. My learning journey began with HTML and CSS, and step by step
      I expanded my skills into JavaScript and Python. I enjoy solving problems and
      finding creative ways to make web pages clean, simple, and easy to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to programming, I have a background in teaching. I taught English
      in Iran, and now in Canada I teach children about ancient Persian stories,
      especially <em>Shahnameh</em>. Sharing these cultural stories is a way for me
      to connect my roots with my new community. I love creating lessons that are fun,
      interactive, and inspiring for kids.

      This website is a simple personal profile created as part of my web design
      practice. The goal of the site is to show who I am, my skills, and my passions.
      It also demonstrates my ability to use HTML and CSS in different ways,
      following the requirements of my assignment.

      My favorite website for practice and learning is
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        W3Schools
      </a>.
      I use it to review examples, practice exercises, and discover new features of web technologies.
